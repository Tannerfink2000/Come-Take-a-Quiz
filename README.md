# Js-Quiz

##This code is a JavaScript quiz game that displays multiple-choice questions and tracks the user's score and remaining time. The user must select an answer before the timer runs out, and the game ends when all questions have been answered or the timer reaches zero. The user's final score is saved to local storage and displayed on a separate results page.
